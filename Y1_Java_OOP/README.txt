This application is a rock, paper, scissors application. All you have to do is load it up and click one of the choices, you will either win against the random opponent, lose or draw.

As for key OOP pillars, I know I used encapsulation by having private variables in the Logic.java section and needing getters to access those variables from the GUI.java section to figure out the score and the choice the computer made. Polymorphism may count since I implemented the ActionListener and overrode the actionPerformed method.

SOLID principles: I tried to have everything have a single purpose, a little difficult with such a small program, maybe next time.

The rest of the principles I believe the program is way too simple to even be an issue.

The challenges I faced were numerous, I programmed this while sleep deprived, I was indecisive on what application to build so I built one not recommended. My biggest issue is creating UML diagrams and writing documentation, I think I now have a basic understanding of it but I hope to improve.
